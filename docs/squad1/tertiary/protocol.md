# Quality Evaluation

## Quality Criteria

### QC1 – Are the inclusion and exclusion criteria properly described?

2 - the criteria are explicit  
1 - the criteria are implicit  
0 - criteria are not defined or cannot be easily identified

### QC2 – Does the search cover all relevant studies?

2 - (Uses four or more relevant databases) or (one search engine AND no extra search strategy)  
1 - ((Uses three relevant sources) OR (a search engine)) AND (an extra search strategy)  
0 - (uses a maximum of two relevant sources) AND (no extra search strategy)

### QC3 – Is the quality of included primary studies assessed?

2 - quality criteria are explicit and associated with each primary study  
1 - the secondary study research questions or selection criteria address the quality of the primary study  
0 - quality assessment is not carried out or is not made explicit

### QC4 – Are primary studies adequately described?

2 - the details of each primary study are explicit  
1 - there is only one summary of each study  
0 - there are no results from the primary studies analyzed

### QC5 – Is the justification for the study adequately described?

2 - the justification is duly substantiated and relevant studies are cited as related  
1 - the justification is not clear or relevant studies are not cited  
0 - justification is not cited and without relevant related studies

### QC6 – Is the protocol validation properly described?

2 - a - strings are derived from the research questions;  
    b - the data to be extracted is related to the research questions; and  
    c - the data analysis procedure is appropriate to answer the questions  
1 - a, b or c are absent or not treated adequately  
0 - validation is not described or cannot be easily inferred

### QC7 – Is the extraction properly described and appropriate?

2 - a - extraction form is explicitly described;  
    b - there is a strategy for extracting and recording data duly described; and  
    c - how the data extraction process is carried out and validated  
1 - a, b or c are absent or not treated adequately  
0 - validation is not described or cannot be easily inferred

## Strategy to Select Studies

```text
At this stage, the articles obtained are selected by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in this protocol. Each document will be assigned a status (included, excluded or doubtful) that will be analyzed by the supervisor. The selection will be carried out by three people, one of whom will be called in case of disagreement between the other two.
```

## Strategy to Summarization of Results

```text
Using the extraction form, analyses must be carried out by listing the answers, calculating probabilities or odds ratios and constructing graphs to check the relevance of the results found. The analysis will be carried out by three people, two of them with experience in SE and one in ML and AI.
